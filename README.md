# Thirsty-Group-App
App created as part of a group assignment for COM354 Integrated Multimedia Development module.

This app is designed to streamline the ordering experience in coffee shops, allowing users to order their beverage from a coffee shop of their choosing and customise it. 
The app will show the user the nearest coffee shops to them, e.g. the nearest Starbucks, and allow them to choose a pickup location and time, and an email confirmation receipt will be sent out.

* Project no longer live as it was being hosted on university servers prior to my course transfer.
