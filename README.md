# Thirsty-Group-App
App created as part of a group for COM354 Integrated Multimedia module. 

This app is designed to streamline the ordering experience in coffee shops. This app allows users to order their beverage from a coffee shop of their choosing and customise it to their liking. The app will show the user the nearest coffee shops to them, e.g. the nearest Starbucks, and allow them to choose a pickup location and time. The app will then send out an email confirmation receipt.

(Work in progress - at MVP2 Stage.)
